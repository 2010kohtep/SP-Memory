# SP-Memory

Some stuff for SourcePawn that provides functions for native memory control.

## Includes

* memory.inc: Set of functions for working with native server memory;
* memcall.inc: This file should provide the ability to build a custom function call using SDKCall. Currently in development;
* windows.inc: Set of Windows-specific functions necessary for working with native memory.

## Any examples?

Project has some SP examples, you can find it in **addons/sourcemod/scripting** folder.
